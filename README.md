# skadi

A visual modelling tool for constructing and executing directed graphs.

Skadi allows visual graph based domain specific languages (DSLs) to be quickly easily developed.

Graph-based DSLs use visual programming to help users solve problems in particular niches, a few examples:

* Constructing SQL Queries
* Business Process Modelling
* Bayesian Networks
* Develop Data Science Pipelines

A demo is available [explore and visualise datasets](https://visualtopology.github.io/api/skadi-designer.html) where the DSL is executed by Skadi's optional execution engine - using Javascript running within your web browser.

Skadi is released under the [Open Source License v3.0 ](https://opensource.org/license/osl-3-0-php/).
